I am a person who enjoys working with others also. Interested in the enire front end spectrum and working on ambition project with positive people.
                            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family person, who enjoys listening my husband Matson’s guitar playing at evenings or spending time with my kittens. During my free time you can find me reading an inspiration book, walking in a park, making traditional armenian food, dancing or meditating.</p>
